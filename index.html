<p>High-fidelity, interactable 3D content, such as intelligent virtual humans and interactive virtual environments, drives the creation of compelling graphics innovations such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications. Creating such interactive, smart virtual content goes beyond the traditional graphics goal of attaining visual realism, giving rise to a new wave of exciting opportunities in computer graphics research. This new research frontier aims to close the loop between 3D scanning and content creation, 3D scene and object understanding, virtual human modeling, physical simulations, 3D printing, and AR/VR applications.</p>

<p>This workshop targets at bringing together computer graphics researchers, as well as experts in AR/VR, computer vision, robotics and artificial intelligence, to discuss the research challenges in creating virtual objects, humans and environments especially for enhancing physical and interactive realism. Specific topics of interests include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Affordance analysis of scenes and objects</li>
<li>Physically-grounded scene interpretation</li>
<li>Physics-based design of objects (e.g., for 3D printing)</li>
<li>Cognitive, perceptual and behavioral modeling of virtual humans</li>
<li>Virtual human interaction and human perception</li>
<li>Biomechanics modeling and simulation of human body</li>
<li>Artificial life and crowd simulations</li>
<li>Novel applications of AR/VR/haptic devices</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="paper-submission" class="anchor" href="#paper-submission" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Paper Submission:</h3>

<p>The manuscripts should be submitted as PDF files and should be in 8 to 10 pages in Siggraph paper format. All submissions must be prepared according to the ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines. Each paper will be peer-reviewed by at least two reviewers. Acceptance will be based on relevance to the workshop, novelty, and technical quality. In submitting a manuscript to this workshop, the authors acknowledge that no paper substantially similar in content has been submitted to another workshop or conference during the review period. The proceedings of the workshop will be included in the ACM Digital Library.</p>

<p>All workshop research papers must be original, unpublished work, written and presented in English. All submissions must be prepared according to the ACM SIGGRAPH publication guidelines. At least one author of each accepted workshop paper has to register for SIGGRAPH Asia 2016 (full conference pass) by September 30, 2016, and gives an oral presentation as well as a poster presentation at the workshop. To recognize the contribution of workshop paper presenters, the presenters can apply for a 25% registration discount per accepted paper submission.</p>
